Data science, large language modeling (LLM), natural language processing (NLP), and machine learning researcher with a strong foundation in mathematics, computational physics, numerical optimization,
and large-scale data analysis. My work spans interdisciplinary projects that integrate computational,
experimental, and theoretical approaches to solve complex challenges in scientific research, industry, and
diverse fieldsâ€”including healthcare, materials science, digital humanities, and media innovation. Highly
analytical and driven by innovation, I excel at distilling complex concepts into clear insights and am
committed to continuous learning and problem-solving.
