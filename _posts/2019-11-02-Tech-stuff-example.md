EXPLAINMED is a tool that uses AI, large language models, and NLP (Natural Language Processing) to simplify complex medical reports written in Dutch into everyday language. The system automatically classifies and translates medical terms, making the information more understandable for patients, especially those with heart disease. By breaking down technical jargon, EXPLAINMED helps patients better understand their diagnosis and treatment, improving adherence and potentially reducing healthcare costs.
