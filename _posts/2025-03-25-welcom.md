I am a researcher specializing in data science, large language models (LLMs), natural language processing (NLP), and machine learning, with a robust foundation in Physics, mathematics, computational physics, numerical optimization, and large-scale data analysis. My expertise extends to chatbot development, including conversational AI design, dialogue management systems, intent recognition frameworks, and the implementation of context-aware response generation. I have experience creating, training, and deploying conversational agents using various frameworks and architectures, with skills in both retrieval-based and generative approaches to chatbot design. My work bridges interdisciplinary projects that combine computational, experimental, and theoretical methodologies to address complex challenges across diverse fields such as healthcare, materials science, digital humanities, and media innovation. I am deeply committed to continuous learning and effective problem-solving.
