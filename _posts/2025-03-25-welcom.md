For a complete overview of my background, technical skills, and research philosophy, please visit my 'About,' 'Education,' 'Work Experience,' and 'Skills' pages. You can also reach out to me via the links provided on the 'Contact' page. On this page, I will showcase the most recent projects I have been involved in.
